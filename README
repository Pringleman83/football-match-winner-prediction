ignore all the files and head directly to libsvm-3.21/python
There you fill find two files 'train' and 'test'
'train' file has all training data which has been scaled between -1to1, each line starts as follows
<lable> <index>:<feature_value>
as seen there are three classes
perform grid search to find best values of C and gamma
i performed grid search given in grid.py and found the values of C and Gamma as 8192 and 0.0078125 respectively
next i perfomed training as svm-train -c 8192 -g 0.0078125
this created train.model file
then i used svm-predict test train.model tpredict.predict
now the tpredict.predict is the final prediction file, as seen it only has 2 class values(viz 1,2 and clearly the third class hasnt been classified)


help me in knowing why not the third class was classified? is there something wrong in my libsvm implementation?
