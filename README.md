Football Match Winner Prediction
=================================

### About ###
-----------------------------
This project is about learning and implementing ***machine learning*** models to predict the outcome of football match and identify the winning team. We have extracted and built our ***own features*** that calculates and provides the stats per match. Features are the main essense of our project that highly impacts are end results.

### Technology Stack ### 
-----------------------------
1. Java
2. Python
3. Matlab
4. Linux
5. Machine Learning 
6. Matlab
7. Netbeans


### Feature Extraction ### 
-----------------------------
1. Current Form
    - Home / Away Wins
    - Relative Team Position
2. Attack Quotient
    - Shots on Target
    - Goals Scored
3. Goals Conceded
4. Clean Sheets


### Machine Leaning Models ### 
-----------------------------
1. Logistic Regression
2. Vote Algorithm
    - Naive Bayes Classifier and,
    - Random Forest 

### Graphical User Interface ###
-----------------------------
1. We created a simple graphical user interface that takes in the already built model for a particular year. 
2. Based on the given model it provides prediction results for all the fixtures suggested for that particular year.
3. It also provides a way to look at stats per match defending the idea behind the predicted results.
